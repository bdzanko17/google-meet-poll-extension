Google Meet Poll Plugin

Google Meet is a video-communication service that has been widely used since the COVID-19 outbreak. After the increase in the use of this application, the lack of some functionalities offered by other platforms, such as polls for voting, was noticed. Since this is one of the few free video-communication apps, we have decided to develop an extension for it. The link to download the extension can be found HERE.
Once the extension is downloaded and enabled (More Tools -> Manage Extension -> enable the extension) you can use it in your Google Meet calls. 

How to use manual

To get privileges to ask a question you first need to send a code whatevs is decided insert here. After that, you can send the question one by one. The poll will be shown with options to vote “for”, “against” and “abstained”. If there is no vote submitted, it won’t count in the final results. The results will be shown after number of seconds. Since this is the first version of the application all the results must be saved manually - writing it down or taking a screenshot.

Future work

Currently, the app is compatible only with Google Chrome, and in the future, the number of browsers will be increased. Settings and help panels will be added. The settings panel will include the possibility to change the number of questions, voting duration, duration of preview results, while the help panel will have basic instructions on how to use the extension.
